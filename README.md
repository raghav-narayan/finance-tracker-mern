## Technical Architecture

Financio follows a **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** stack architecture, consisting of the following key components:

1. **Frontend**: Built using React.js, React-Bootstrap, and other React-based libraries for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
2. **Backend**: Developed with Node.js and Express.js, handling server-side logic, API management, and authentication.
3. **Database**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used to store user data, transactions, budgets, and other financial information.
4. **Security and Integrations**: Leverages technologies like JWT for secure authentication, bcryptjs for password hashing, and CORS for managing cross-origin requests.
5. **Tools and Libraries**: The project utilizes a variety of tools and libraries, including Git for version control, Postman for API testing, and third-party packages like Chart.js for data visualization.

## Run Locally

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (for local development, or you can use MongoDB Atlas)
- **Npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/finance-tracker-mern.git
   cd finance-tracker-mern
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/config` folder and add the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB URI.

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Navigate to both the `backend` and `frontend` directories and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Start the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:

   From the `backend` folder, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the backend server, usually at `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Start the Frontend**:

   From the `frontend` folder, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the frontend development server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Access the Application

Once both servers are running, you can access the application by opening your browser and navigating to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Additional Information

- The application requires a valid MongoDB connection. For production use, consider deploying MongoDB to a cloud service such as [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
- The frontend is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring it works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
